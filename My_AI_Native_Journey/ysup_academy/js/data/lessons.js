        content: `Welcome to the Pursuit AI-Native Program Launch! Today is Day 1 of your AI-native journey. Our objectives are to build your support system, increase collaboration, set you up for success, get to know your community, and learn more about the pilot (structure, expectations, your support team, schedule, and resources).
        <br><br>
        The AI-Native Program focuses on understanding 'What' AI is reshaping technology and society, 'Why' you need to be AI-native for future jobs, and 'How' through skills & training.
        <br><br>
        Key roles: Dave Yang (Creative & brand at Pursuit), Afiya Augustine (Your success!).
        <br><br>
        We also looked at 'Vibe Coding' which suggests that for the Winter 2025 batch, 95% of lines of code will be LLM generated. Y Combinator (YC) is a tech startup accelerator and venture capital firm that launched companies like AirBnb, Stripe, Doordash.`,

        You'll learn foundational AI prompting to direct AI (Gemini) to generate simple code (Python script & HTML page). You'll also understand GitHub basics with AI guidance for saving and organizing your AI-generated work.
        <br><br>
        Words of the Day:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical:</strong> Prompt (An instruction or question you give to an AI to get a specific response or action.)</li>
            <li><strong>Business:</strong> Iteration (The process of repeating a cycle of development, making small improvements each time to refine a product or idea.)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Morning Huddle (10:00 AM - 10:15 AM): Set goals for the day and share an insight from Saturday. Activities: Day overview, Share one thing you're excited to try with AI today.

        L2L/Tech: Prompting Fundamentals 101 (10:15 AM - 11:30 AM): Learn core AI prompting techniques for effective AI direction. Activities: Practice giving AI (Gemini) clear instructions and sufficient context; Learn how to iterate on AI's output by refining prompts (e.g., 'Make it funnier', 'Make it more professional'); Guided exercises in prompting for simple text generation and code ideas.
        <br><br>
        Tech/Build: AI, Build My "Hello World!" (11:30 AM - 12:30 PM): Direct AI to generate your first simple Python script and HTML page. Activities: Prompt Gemini: 'Generate a simple Python script that prints a personalized welcome message!'; Prompt Gemini: 'Generate a basic HTML page with a title that says My AI Journey Begins!'; Use Cursor to save these AI-generated files.

export const welcomeMessage = `Welcome to YsUp AI-Native Academy @ Pursuit! Your objective is to learn everything taught in class before the bell rings by asking questions and scoring more YBUCKS as a team than the teacher (me, the computer). Let's start with the rules:
<br><br>
<strong>Rules:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ask:</strong> Students are encouraged to ask questions about the lecture without fear. You can write down your questions and answers before asking for assistance.</li>
    <li><strong>Assistance:</strong> The first student to raise their hand with the correct answer, or the team captain or teacher, can assist the student with their question. However, players cannot give away any answers. Instead, they must use clever questions, hints, examples, formulas, etc. to help the student arrive at the answer on their own.</li>
    <li><strong>No Cheating:</strong> Cheating is not allowed in the game. Players cannot give away any answers, and they must use clever questions, hints, examples, formulas, etc. to help the student arrive at the answer on their own.</li>
</ul>
