## Introduction
This repository serves as a personal log and showcase of my progress in building AI-native applications and understanding the core concepts behind them. It will contain code, notes, and experiments.

## Goals
* To learn and implement best practices for AI-native development.
* To explore various AI frameworks and tools (e.g., Large Language Models, Vector Databases, Agents).
* To build practical AI-native applications.
* To share my learnings with the community.

## Technologies
* Python
* (Add specific AI frameworks/libraries you plan to use, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI API, etc.)
* (Add databases, cloud platforms, etc.)

## Projects
